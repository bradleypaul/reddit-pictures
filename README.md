# reddit-pictures
Vue.js app that gets pictures from reddit in a simplified view, somewhat akin to [redditp.com](https://redditp.com) ([Source](https://github.com/ubershmekel/redditp)) by [ubershmekel](https://github.com/ubershmeckel).

Setting up project for localhost:
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bradleypaul/reddit-pictures.git
$ cd reddit-pictures
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```

Then just follow Vue.js's instructions output on the terminal. :)
